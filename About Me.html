   		<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
	</header>
    	
    <p>I am many things and have many interests.</p>
	<p>I am the mother of two beautiful girls, an member of the Health Services team at Holland America Line, and a 3/4 time student.</p>
	<p>My interests range from computer "stuff" of which I am learning a ton, quillting and sewing, knitting and crocheting, jewelry making, reading, hiking (my sanity!), padde boarding, and many, many other things.</p>
	<p>Here's a picture of me and my friend Greg on our big adventure - we hiked the Jakita Ridge/Devil's Dome loop trail in 2014. It was amazing.</p>
